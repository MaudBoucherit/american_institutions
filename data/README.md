## Description of the data

I will be visualizing a dataset of approximately 7,800 American post-secondary institutions. The data were collected regarding the academic year 2015-2016. It contains 30 variables that provide basic descriptive information about it (name, location, private status), the average annual cost of attendance, information about the student body (share of women, ethnic distribution, incomes distribution), the number of students having financial aid, if college was completed, and average and median earnings of former students, from 6 to 10 years after graduation.    

These data come from federal reporting from institutions, data on federal financial aid, and tax information.   
The full original dataset can be found [here](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) along with the documentation report and the data dictionary.
